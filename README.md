## How's the weather, Seattle?

### What even is this?

Inspired by the 100 days of CSS challenge -- specifically, inspired by day 9 -- I wanted to make a little widget that shows the current state of Seattle's weather.

### If I want to play with it myself, what should I do after cloning?

You'll need Node.js 8.0.0+ installed. I've been developing this on 11.4.0, but you should be able to get by with an older version if that's what you have.

To install dependencies:
```
yarn
```

To bundle the scripts once:
```
yarn build
```

To bundle the scripts every time you change a file eventually imported through `src/index.js`:
```
yarn build:watch
```

To see random notes I've left for myself
```
yarn todo
```

To run the tests, you'll have to write some first. Poor choices that will come back to haunt me include.... @_@
